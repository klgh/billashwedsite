                    <p>
                        Well, the week of my 21st Birthday, Bill told me that he was going to talk to my parents in about a week to ask them if he could marry me. Little did I know, this stinker actually talked to my parents well in advance. I knew Bill and I were planning on going out to an early lunch for my Birthday. He had a gig later that night, so we planned this ahead of time. Bill picked me up and took me to Macaroni Grill. Funny enough, they had a special on their wine, so we ended up ordering a bottle and enjoyed a glass with our meal. After we finished eating, I assumed we would have to go back home because Bill needed to drive to his gig and I had plans to go out to dinner with my family. Instead, Bill asked me if I wanted to go to a park and walk around. This is one of our favorite things to do. Bill and I love to be outdoors whether it is a park or a random trail, so as you can guess, of course I wanted to go. I ended up picking Sims Lake Park in Suwanee, GA. This is my favorite park. When I was nannying out in Suwanee, I spent many days taking Christian to the park. They have a wonderful path around a scenic pond. This has always been one of my favorite places to relax and reflect. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, we started walking around the path, hand-in-hand, talking about all sorts of things. Bill made fun of me because I have an eye for spotting turtles. In the lake, there is always this particular spot where the turtles like to hangout. I always find it fascinating and a story worth sharing with the little ones. As we walked around, we made our way to the other side of the lake, when Bill stopped me. I couldn’t register what was happening until he got down on his knee and asked me to marry him. Out of shock, I said, “Wait, seriously? YES!” I wasn’t expecting him to ask because he just told me he was going to talk to my parents later. I couldn’t even talk for the first couple minutes. I am pretty sure my face was frozen with a smile. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is one of the happiest moments of my life! <br>
                        Right after, we decided to bring some champagne to my house and celebrate with the family before Bill had to leave for his gig. <br>
                        I am happy to share this love story with you! We can’t wait to experience and live out this new stage in our lives. <br>
                        Love, <br>
